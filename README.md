# Stock Data Analysis VBA Script
# This VBA script, stock_data_analysis, is designed to perform a basic analysis of stock data across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook. The script calculates the yearly change and percentage change for each stock and applies conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes. Additionally, the script identifies the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume across all worksheets.
